## **Wednesday**

![Box Model]

1. Describe the following 
    - padding 
    - margin 
    - `position: fixed` - 
    - `position: relative` 
    - `position: absolute` 
    - `position: static` 
    - The MC quiz from earlier in the week is good for positioning stuff.

1. Identify elements rendered with specific padding and margin settings

1. Apply padding and margins to HTML elements to achieve a desired layout

1. Apply positioning settings to elements (fixed, relative, and absolute) to HTML elements to achieve a desired layout

1. Identify which HTML elements have a default "inline" display value
    - `fill in`

1. Identify which HTML elements have a default "block" display value
    - `fill in`

1. Describe and use z-index positioning of elements
    

1. Explain how flexible box layout lays out elements

1. For the following LOs please revisit your project work and project solutions (i.e. AA Times, Wednesday EOD demo, etc.) for how you've done the following:

    - Use the flex property to specify `grow`, `shrink`, and `basis` values.
    - `grow` determines how much available space it will take up
    - `shrink` determines how much the element can shrink
    - `basis` is considered to be the default size of the element
    - Use the `flex-direction` property to direct the layout of the content.
    - Use the `flex-wrap` property to affect the wrap of content layout within an element using flexible box layout.
    - Use `align-self`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to change the way that children elements are laid out in a flexible box layout.
    - Use the `order` property to change the order in which elements will appear in a flexible box layout.

    - Use the `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-template` properties to specify the layout of the grid using relative and absolute measures.

    - Use `grid-template-areas` to label areas of a grid and `grid-area` to assign an element to the area.

    - Use `grid-column-gap`, `grid-row-gap`, and `grid-gap` to set the "gutter" areas between elements in a grid layout.

    - Use `grid-column-start`/`grid-column-end `and `grid-row-start`/`grid-row-end`to create spans across multiple columns and rows with positive integers, negative integers, and in conjunction with the "span" operator.

    - Use `justify-items`, `align-items`, `justify-content` and `align-content` to layout items in each grid area.

    - Use the `order` property to change the default order in which items are laid out

1. Explain how grid layout lays out elements

1. Explain and use the shorthand versions of `grid-column` and `grid-row` to define how an element will span a grid layout

1. Explain and use the "fr" unit of measure
    
## **Thursday**

1. Describe what `Block`, `Element`, and `Modifier` means in BEM
